# Bird Perch

Made in Blender with (almost only) Geo Nodes (because there is no [Mesh Bevel Node](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/86841)). You can some what easily edit it.

* Clamp diameter.
* Stick length.

Currently you can only do a circle clamp. I might add a square clamp when there is a [Mesh Bevel Node](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/86841).
